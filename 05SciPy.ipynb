    "\n",
    "As a last example, I want to show how you can **combine** these two techniques to solves a truly hard engineering equation with just a couple lines of code. Dividing complex problems down to pieces that you can solve with simple methods and combining them back together to obtain the solution is the secret sauce of programming and well worth learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The governing equations for viscous fluids are very difficult to deal with, both [mathematically](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/navier%E2%80%93stokes-equation) and [numerically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence_modeling). But these equations can be simplified in the case of a laminar flow along a flat plate. In this case we expect the velocity $u=0$ on the plate because of friction, but then to rapidly increase up to an asymptotic value $u\\rightarrow U$. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Blasius1.png](attachment:Blasius1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This thin region of slowed down flow is called the boundary layer and we want to predict the shape of the *velocity profile* in this region. The [Blasius equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasius_boundary_layer) governs this shape:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A'''+\\frac{1}{2} A A'' = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A'(z) = u/U$ is the scaled velocity function and $z$ is the scaled distance from the wall. The function $A$ has the boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A(0) = A'(0) = 0 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad A'(\\infty) = 1 $$\n",
    "\n",

It is hard to deal with infinity numerically, but we see in the plot above that the profile is pretty much constant for z>4 anyway, so we'll just apply this condition to the last point, ie `blasius(C0)[-1]=1`. This is an implicit equation for `C0`, and we can solve it using `fsolve` as we did above: we simply substract the right-hand-side and define `func = blasius(C0)[-1]-1` which is zero when `C0` satisfies the boundary condition. Uncomment the line in the code block above to check that it works.\n",
