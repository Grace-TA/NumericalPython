    "We have established the main features of Python, but up to this point we have only created simple functions and applied them to create lists of numbers. Even for simple tasks like this, the programming approach is **highly** preferred to using spreadsheets (like `Excel`) which are [extremely dangerous to use for important work](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/02/13/microsofts-excel-might-be-the-most-dangerous-software-on-the-planet/?sh=536d1fa0633d). Well documented spreadsheet errors have led to catastrophes in [business](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/88-of-spreadsheets-have-errors-2013-04-17), [economic policy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-18/faq-reinhart-rogoff-and-the-excel-error-that-changed-history) and [healthcare](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/how-excel-may-have-caused-loss-of-16000-covid-tests-in-england). This is because:\n",
    "1. Spreadsheets *hide their methodology* behind the data. This makes it extremely difficult to transfer methods to new data and to find errors. In contrast, a program *is* the methodology, making testing and reproduction much easier.  \n",
    "1. Spreadsheets are not extensible. Their available numerical methods make them inappropriate for any advanced engineering analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast we can easily extend the base-language of Python for arbitrarily advanced numerical work. We only need to import some additional libraries to address key issues with the base-language:\n",
    " - There are no built-in data structures for arrays, matrices, and tables (unlike, say, `Matlab` or `Julia`).\n",
    " - Using lists of `float` numbers is generally very slow and lacks useful built-in features like matrix multiplication.\n",
    " - There is no built-in method to visualize data in plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will introduce the `NumPy` and `PyPlot` libraries to address these issues."
