# Introduction to Numerical Python for Engineers

**Hello**! Numerical programming is becoming a key skill for modern engineers and you will need to use Python in some of your modules for labs and coursework. This is a quick introduction to numerical programming in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using a set of interactive  [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. 
1. [Python Basics](https://colab.research.google.com/github/weymouth/NumericalPython/blob/main/01PythonBasics.ipynb)
1. [Conditionals and Lists](https://colab.research.google.com/github/weymouth/NumericalPython/blob/main/02ConditionalsAndLists.ipynb)
1. [Numerical Python and Plotting](https://colab.research.google.com/github/weymouth/NumericalPython/blob/main/03NumpyAndPlotting.ipynb)

## How to complete this introduction?

You can use these notebooks in two ways:
- You can run the notebooks on [google colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html). This is extremely convenient, requiring nothing but a Google account! Just click the links above to get started.
- Alternatively, you can run the notebooks on your own machine. To do this, you need to download this github repository using the green `code` button above; for example as a [zip file](https://github.com/weymouth/NumericalPython/archive/main.zip) or using github desktop. If you haven't already, you should also [install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). This will install Python and the Jupyter notebook environment, letting you run the notebooks locally.

## Why use programming for analysis?

The programming approach is **highly** preferred to using spreadsheets (like `Excel`) which are [extremely dangerous to use for important work](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/02/13/microsofts-excel-might-be-the-most-dangerous-software-on-the-planet/?sh=536d1fa0633d). Well documented spreadsheet errors have led to catastrophes in [business](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/88-of-spreadsheets-have-errors-2013-04-17), [economic policy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-18/faq-reinhart-rogoff-and-the-excel-error-that-changed-history) and [health care](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/how-excel-may-have-caused-loss-of-16000-covid-tests-in-england). This is because:
1. Spreadsheets *hide their methodology* behind the data. This makes it extremely difficult to transfer methods to new data and to find errors. In contrast, a program *is* the methodology, making testing and reproduction much easier.
1. Spreadsheets are not extensible. Their available numerical methods make them inappropriate for any advanced engineering analysis.

## Why use Python?

Python is not the only programming language for numerics, but it has a few important advantages:
- It is incredibly popular. The figure above was generated on [stackoverflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends) and show that Python's user base five times larger than any other programming language used for numerical work.
  1. This means there is a large and well organized community of users developing new aspect of Python and providing help and education.
  1. It also means learning Python is a good way to improve your job prospects. This is particularly true for engineering positions related to data-science and machine learning.
- It is open-source and free to use. This helps the community grow and also ensures future employers can use your skills - no need to pay for a Matlab license. 
- Python is easy to learn and the lessons are generally transferable to other languages. A basis in Python will help make other modern languages like [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) more approachable.
