# Introduction to Numerical Python for Engineers

**Hello**! Numerical programming is becoming a key skill for modern engineers and you will need to use Python in some of your modules for labs and coursework. This is a quick introduction to numerical programming in [Python](https://www.python.org/) to help you get started. 

## How to complete this introduction

This introduction covers the basics of numerical python using a set of interactive  [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. You can use these notebooks in two ways:
1. You can run the notebooks on [google colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html). This is extremely convenient, requiring nothing but a Google account! Select the notebook you want from the source list above and then click the blue colab button at the top.
2. You can run the notebooks on your own machine. To do this, you need to download this github repository using the green `code` button above; for example as a [zip file](https://github.com/weymouth/NumericalPython/archive/main.zip) or using github desktop. If you haven't already, you should also [install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). This will install Python and the Jupyter notebook environment, letting you run the notebooks locally.

## Why use Python for numerics

The programming approach is **highly** preferred to using spreadsheets (like `Excel`) which are [extremely dangerous to use for important work](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/02/13/microsofts-excel-might-be-the-most-dangerous-software-on-the-planet/?sh=536d1fa0633d). Well documented spreadsheet errors have led to catastrophes in [business](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/88-of-spreadsheets-have-errors-2013-04-17), [economic policy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-18/faq-reinhart-rogoff-and-the-excel-error-that-changed-history) and [health care](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/how-excel-may-have-caused-loss-of-16000-covid-tests-in-england). This is because:
1. Spreadsheets *hide their methodology* behind the data. This makes it extremely difficult to transfer methods to new data and to find errors. In contrast, a program *is* the methodology, making testing and reproduction much easier.
1. Spreadsheets are not extensible. Their available numerical methods make them inappropriate for any advanced engineering analysis.

Python is not the only programming language for numerics, but it has a few important advantages:
1. It is incredibly popular. The figure above was generated on [stackoverflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends) and show that Python's user base is an order of magnitude larger than any other programming language used for numerical work.
1. This means there is a large and well organized community of users developing new aspect of Python and providing help and education.
1. It also means learning Python is a good way to improve your job prospects. This is particularly true for engineering positions related to data-science and machine learning.
1. It is open-source and free to use. This helps the community grow and also ensures future employers can use your skills - no need to pay for a Matlab license. 
1. Python is easy to learn and the lessons are generally transferable to other languages. A basis in Python will help make other modern languages like [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) more approachable.
