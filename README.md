# Introduction to Numerical Python for Engineers

**Hello**! Numerical programming is becoming a key skill for modern engineers and you will need to use Python in some of your modules for labs and coursework. This is a quick introduction to numerical programming in [Python](https://www.python.org/) to help you get started. 

We introduce these concepts using a set of interactive  [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. You can use these notebooks in two ways:
1. You can run the notebooks on [google colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html). This is extremely convienient, requiring nothing but a google account! Select the notebook you want from the source list above and then click the blue colab button at the top.
2. You can run the notebooks on your own machine. To do this, you need to download this github repository using the green `code` button above; for example as a [zip file](https://github.com/weymouth/NumericalPython/archive/main.zip) or using github desktop. If you haven't already, you should also [install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). This will install Python and the Jupyter notebook environment, letting you run the notebooks locally.
